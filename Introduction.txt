Introduction
===============================================================================
In the post-Moore era of computing systems development, a new challenge arises computer engineers must be ready to face -- increase of computing power, without increase of transistor count on die. And the obvious way to do this -- more efficient usage of die area. Which chived by full control of design process for chip by developer. Although this undertaking is complex by itself, it can be mitigated by automation [link to my article on IEEE], especially in part of transformation of semantic solution to specific form.
In case of transformation of semantic solution to hardware representation, an universal form of hardware representation of computing hardware must be defined, as well as form of interaction of user with such hardware computing device.
Domain of this research is narrowed to FPGAs, which allow reconfiguration of solutions they contain in runtime, increasing in this way practical gain of such approach. FPGAs are especially effective in interaction hardware processor systems. Both major producers of FPGA chips, Altera and Xilinx are proposing such SoC solutions: Cyclone V, Arria 10, Stratix 10, MPSoC[,,,]. Even Intel announced new Xeon CPU with integrated FPGA []. Verilog is chosen  as language for representation of hardware solution.
